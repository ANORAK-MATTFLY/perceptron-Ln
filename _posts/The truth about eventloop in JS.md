# The truth about Event Loop üç¶ (Part 1)

JavaScript  was  designed  as  an  embedded  scripting  language.  JavaScript  programs  do  not  run  as  stand-alone applications,  but  as scripts  in  the  context  of  a  larger  application.  The  flagship  example is,  of  course,  the  web  browser.  A  browser  can  have  many  windows and  tabs  running  multiple  web  applications,  each  responding  to  various  inputs  and  stimuli:  user  actions  via  keyboard,  mouse,  or touch, the arrival of data from the network, or timed alarms. These 
events  can  occur  at  any  point‚Äîeven  simultaneously‚Äîduring  the lifetime of a web application. And for each kind of event, the application may wish to be notified of information and respond with custom 
behavior.
JavaScript‚Äôs  approach  to  writing  programs  that  respond  to  multiple concurrent events is remarkably user-friendly and powerful, using a 
combination of a simple execution model, sometimes known as event-
queue  or  event-loop  concurrency,  with  what  are  known  as  asynchronous APIs. Thanks to the effectiveness of this approach, as well as the 
fact  that  JavaScript  is  standardized  independently  of  web  browsers, JavaScript is used as the programming language for a variety of other 
applications,  from  desktop  applications  to  server-side  frameworks such as Node.js.
Curiously, the ECMAScript standard has, to date, never said a word 
about  concurrency.  Consequently,  this  chapter  deals  with  ‚Äúde  facto‚Äù characteristics of JavaScript rather than the official standard. Nevertheless,  most  JavaScript  environments  share  the  same  approach  to concurrency, and future versions of the standard may standardize on 
this widely implemented execution model. Regardless of the standard, 
working with events and asynchronous APIs is a fundamental part of 
programming in JavaScript.

## Don't block the Event queue on I/O ü•û

JavaScript programs are structured around events: inputs that may 
come  in  simultaneously  from  a  variety  of  external  sources,  such  as interactions from a user (clicking a mouse button, pressing a key, or touching a screen), incoming network data, or scheduled alarms. In 
some languages, it‚Äôs customary to write code that waits for a particular input:

```javascript
var text = downloadSync("http://example.com/file.txt");
console.log(text);
```

> The console.log API is a common utility in JavaScript platforms for 
> printing  out  debugging  information  to  a  developer  console.

Functions  such  as  `downloadSync`  are  known  as  synchronous,  or  blocking:
The program stops doing any work while it waits for its input in this case, the result of downloading a file over the internet. Since the computer could be doing other useful work while it waits for the download to  complete,  such  languages  typically  provide  the  programmer  with a way to create multiple threads: subcomputations that are executed 
concurrently,  allowing  one  portion  of  the  program  to  stop  and  wait for (‚Äúblock on‚Äù) a slow input while another portion of the program can carry on usefully doing independent work.

In  JavaScript,  most  I/O  operations  are  provided  through  asynchronous,  or  nonblocking  APIs.  Instead  of  blocking  a  thread  on  a  result, the  programmer  provides  a  callback  (see  Item  19)  for  the  system  to invoke once the input arrives:

```javascript
downloadAsync("http://example.com/file.txt", function(text) {
    console.log(text);
});
```

Rather than blocking on the network, this API initiates the download process and then immediately returns after storing the callback in an internal  registry.  At  some  point  later,  when  the  download  ha s  completed, the system calls the registered callback, passing it the text of the downloaded file as its argument.
Now, the system does not just jump right in and call the callback the instant  the  download  completes.  JavaScript  is  sometimes  described as providing a run-to-completion guarantee: Any user code that is currently  running  in  a  shared  context,  such  as  a  single  web  page  in  a browser,  or  a  single  running  instance  of  a  web  server,  is  allowed  to finish  executing  before  the  next  event  handler  is  invoked.  In  effect, the system maintains an internal queue of events as they occur, and invokes any registered callbacks one at a time.

The image below shows an illustration of example event queues in client-side and  server-side  applications.  As  events  occur,  they  are  added  to  the end  of  the  application‚Äôs  event  queue  (at  the  top  of  the  diagram).  The JavaScript  system  executes  the  application  with  an  internal  event loop, which plucks events off of the bottom of the queue‚Äîthat is, in the order in which they were received‚Äîand calls any registered Java Script event handlers (callbacks like the one passed to `downloadAsync` above) one at a time, passing the event data as arguments to the handlers.

The benefit of the run-to-completion guarantee is that when your code runs,  you  know  that  you  have  complete  control  over  the  application state: You never have to worry that some variable or object property will change out from under you due to concurrently executing code. This  has  the  pleasant  result  that  concurrent  programming  in  Java-Script tends to be much easier than working with threads and locks in languages such as C++, Java, or C#.

Conversely,  the  drawback  of  run-to-completion  is  that  any  and  all code  you  write  effectively  holds  up  the  rest  of  the  application  from proceeding.  In  interactive  applications  like  the  browser,  a  blocked event handler prevents any other user input from being handled and can even prevent the rendering of a page, leading to an unresponsive user  experience.  In  a  server  setting,  a  blocked  handler  can  prevent other network requests from being handled, leading to an unresponsive server.

The  single  most  important  rule  of  concurrent  JavaScript  is  never  to use  any  blocking  I/O  APIs  in  the  middle  of  an  application‚Äôs  event queue.  In  the  browser,  hardly  any  blocking  APIs  are  even  available, although  a  few  have  sadly  leaked  into  the  platform  over  the  years. The `XMLHttpRequest` library, which provides network I/O similar to the `downloadAsync` function above, has a synchronous version that is considered bad form. Synchronous I/O has disastrous consequences for the interactivity of a web application, preventing the user from interacting with a page until the I/O operation completes.

By contrast, asynchronous APIs are safe for use in an event-based setting, because they force your application logic to continue processing in a separate ‚Äúturn‚Äù of the event loop. In the examples above, imagine that it takes a couple of seconds to download the URL. In that time, an enormous number of other events may occur. In the synchronous implementation,  those  events  would  pile  up  in  the  event  queue,  but the event loop would be stuck waiting for the JavaScript code to finish executing, preventing the processing of any other events. But in the asynchronous version, the JavaScript code registers an event handler and  returns  immediately,  allowing  other  event  handlers  to  process intervening events before the download completes

In  settings  where  the  main  application‚Äôs  event  queue  is  unaffected, blocking operations are less problematic. For example, the web platform  provides  the  Worker  API,  which  makes  it  possible  to  spawn concurrent computations. Unlike conventional threads, workers are  executed  in  a  completely  isolated  state,  with  no  access  to  the global  scope  or  web  page  contents  of  the  application‚Äôs  main  thread, so they cannot interfere with the execution of code running in from the main event queue. In a worker, using the synchronous variant of `XMLHttpRequest` is less problematic; blocking on a download does prevent the Worker from continuing, but it does not prevent the page from rendering  or  the  event  queue  from  responding  to  events.  In  a  server setting,  blocking  APIs  are  unproblematic  during  startup,  that  is, before the server begins responding to incoming requests. But when 
servicing requests, blocking APIs are every bit as catastrophic as in the event queue of the browser.

### Things to Remember  üß†

- Asynchronous APIs take callbacks to defer processing of expensive 
  operations and avoid blocking the main application.
- JavaScript  accepts  events  concurrently  but  processes  event  handlers sequentially using an event queue.
- Never use blocking I/O in an application‚Äôs event queue
